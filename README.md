**Description:**
>>>>>>> db295f46dbe6a802c054b9453d5ab16767d974f6
- Build a machine leaning pipline to classify Iris flower species using the classic Iris FLower Dataset [https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201)
- Preprocessed the csv dataset by splitting features and labels, then converting datasets into Nympy arrays and using scikit-learns labelencoder converted str labelt to 46bits int
- Split the dataset into trainning and testing set
- Converted NumPy arrays into PyTorch tensors to prepare for deep learning model training.
